# This folder
This folder contains examples of interlinear texts, that were created with the Interlinear-Text-Creator and then exported to pdf.

## Explanation on the folder-structure:
- For example the folder "texts_for_spanish_speakers" contains texts that people who already speak spanish can use to learn other languages.
- The sub-folders to this folder represent possible languages a spanish-speaking person may want to learn. In these folders, the spanish-speaking person can find the texts to learn these languages.

## Note
Please note that the php-app in itself does not produce pdf-files (as of now), but the files were exported manually into the pdf-format.
